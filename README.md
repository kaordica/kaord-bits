# kaord-bits

This repo is meant to hold useful code bits and snippets for [Kaordica](https://kaordica.com.br)'s workflow and development process.

## Features

We're adding new stuff as we mature on our workflow... as of now, it only includes:

- some useful user snippets for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/);
- and a schema scaffold for [Sanity](https://sanity.io).
